# chess-sdl

minesweeper made in sdl. It is unfinished and im working on [something else](https://github.com/mativ123/obel2d) at the moment, but im most likely going to come back to it.

## installation
you will have to compile it youself. I use g++ on arch but, you will have to use visual studio or minGW on windows.
